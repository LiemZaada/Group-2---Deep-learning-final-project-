Email Spam Detection - Data Preprocessing and Visualization

The main focus of this phase is on preprocessing and visualizing dataset related to email spam detection.
The cleaned and processed data will be used later to train a deep learning model for classifying emails as spam or legitimate. 
Some of the visualizations were performed on the smaller datasets to gain insights into specific patterns and trends while the preprocessing itself was conducted on the extensive dataset (Phishing Emails). 

Preprocessing phases- 

Data Cleaning:

Text Normalization: All text is converted to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
Duplicate Removal: The script identifies and removes duplicate entries to eliminate redundancy.
Handling Missing Values: There was no missing data.
Outlier Removal: Analyze the text length and other relevant parameters to identify and remove outliers. 

Preprocessing:

Tokenization: Tokenization of the text field into individual tokens.
Stop Words Removal: stop words  are removed to enhance model performance.
Stemming: Words are reduced to their root form

Visualization phase- 

Word Distribution Analysis
Most common words in each catagory 
Pareto calculation 
Distribution of email length in each catagory 
Email domain Exploration

After visualizing and preprocessing the raw data, it is now ready for the next phase- models training (:
